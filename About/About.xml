  <description>This is a fork of: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2918473100 \br I fixed a bug which blocked mechs from cooking and also added additional options to control variety for slaves and prisoners.\br Pawns now have a need to eat a variety of ingredients. Pawns have an expected number of ingredient varieties based on their expectation level. Consistently exceeding or failing to meet their expectation will result in positive or negative moods.
